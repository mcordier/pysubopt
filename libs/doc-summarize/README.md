# DocumentSummarization

Summarization is a classic text processing problem. Broadly speaking, given one or more documents, the goal is to obtain a concise piece of text that contains the most important information of the document. Summarization has been studied for the past years in various settingsâ€”multi-document summarization, summarization using concept spaces in machine learning, Determinantal point processes, submodular optimization. Each domain throws up its own set of improvement, which can be combined together.

While there have been many approaches to automatic summarization, our work is directly inspired by the framework of **Lin and Bilmes (2011)**.  In this framework, each of the constraints (relevance, redundancy, etc.) is captured as a submodular function and the objective is to maximize their sum. A simple greedy algorithm is guaranteed to produce an approximately optimal summary. This framework obtains the best results on the DUC 2004 dataset. In this this project, we aim at comparing this approach with a more classical one (MMR) using an accelerated modified greedy algorithm.

## Modeling

### Problem formulation
We introduce first the following notations :
-  The ground set $V$ corresponds to all the sentences in a document.
- Extractive document summarization: select a small subset $S$ that accurately represents the document (ground set V).
- The summary is required to be length-limited : \\
        - c(S) : cost  for sentences S (e.g., the number of words in all sentences of S) \\
        - b: the budget (e.g., the largest length allowed) \\
- A set function $f : 2^V \xrightarrow{} \mathbf{R}$ measures the quality of the summary S,

Thus, we can formulate the problem as follow
$\begin{definition}{Document Summarization Optimization Problem}
        \begin{equation}
           S^* \in \argmax_{S\subset V} f(S) \qquad \text{subject to} \quad c(S) \leq B
        \end{equation}
\end{definition}$

This problem is NP-hard and we are looking for some methods to compute near-optimal strategies.
### Submodular optimization
### Definition

Let $V$ be a finite set, and denote by $2^V$ the power set of $V$, i.e., the family of all subsets of $V$. A function $f: 2^V \xrightarrow{} \mathbf{R}$ is called submodular if, for each $A,B \in 2^V$, we have: 
$
\begin{equation}
    f(A) + f(B) \geq f(A\cap B) +f(A \cup B).
\end{equation}
$
